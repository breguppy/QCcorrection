\title{Install all optional dependencies}
\usage{
install_all_dependencies()
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a character vector of newly installed package names.
}
\description{
Installs all packages listed in the \strong{Suggests} field of QCcorrection that
enable optional functionality such as random forest correction, outlier detection,
reporting, testing, and PDF export.
}
\details{
The function checks which of the optional packages are not already installed
and installs only the missing ones from CRAN. It does not reinstall packages
that are already present.

This helper is useful for users installing QCcorrection from GitHub with
\code{remotes::install_github()}, which does not automatically install
packages listed in \emph{Suggests}.

The optional packages are:
\itemize{
  \item \pkg{randomForest}, \pkg{robustbase}, \pkg{outliers}, \pkg{EnvStats}, \pkg{corpcor} – statistical methods for correction and outlier detection
  \item \pkg{ggtext}, \pkg{cowplot} – enhanced plotting and figure assembly
  \item \pkg{pagedown}, \pkg{rmarkdown}, \pkg{zip}, \pkg{knitr} – report generation and export
  \item \pkg{httpuv}, \pkg{jsonlite}, \pkg{pkgload} – internal testing and Shiny app support
  \item \pkg{shinytest2}, \pkg{testthat}, \pkg{chromote} – automated testing and headless browser rendering
}
